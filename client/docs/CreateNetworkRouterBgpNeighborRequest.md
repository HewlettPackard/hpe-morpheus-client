## Methods

### NewCreateNetworkRouterBgpNeighborRequest

`func NewCreateNetworkRouterBgpNeighborRequest() *CreateNetworkRouterBgpNeighborRequest`

NewCreateNetworkRouterBgpNeighborRequest instantiates a new CreateNetworkRouterBgpNeighborRequest object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewCreateNetworkRouterBgpNeighborRequestWithDefaults

`func NewCreateNetworkRouterBgpNeighborRequestWithDefaults() *CreateNetworkRouterBgpNeighborRequest`

NewCreateNetworkRouterBgpNeighborRequestWithDefaults instantiates a new CreateNetworkRouterBgpNeighborRequest object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetNetworkRouterBgpNeighbor

`func (o *CreateNetworkRouterBgpNeighborRequest) GetNetworkRouterBgpNeighbor() map[string]interface{}`

GetNetworkRouterBgpNeighbor returns the NetworkRouterBgpNeighbor field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetNetworkRouterBgpNeighborOk

`func (o *CreateNetworkRouterBgpNeighborRequest) GetNetworkRouterBgpNeighborOk() (*map[string]interface{}, bool)`

GetNetworkRouterBgpNeighborOk returns a tuple with the NetworkRouterBgpNeighbor field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetNetworkRouterBgpNeighbor

`func (o *CreateNetworkRouterBgpNeighborRequest) SetNetworkRouterBgpNeighbor(v map[string]interface{})`

SetNetworkRouterBgpNeighbor sets NetworkRouterBgpNeighbor field to given value.

### HasNetworkRouterBgpNeighbor
